  synopsis: |
    This role installs Docker via the means of your distribution and configures it. Simple as that.

    There are many Ansible roles for Docker available but most of them do some crazy stuff to get Docker up and running.
    This is not necessary on up-to-date distributions anymore.

    If you use [mlocate], have a look at the role [tersmitten.updatedb].

    ### Credits

    This role reuses some templates files and variables names from [tersmitten.docker].
